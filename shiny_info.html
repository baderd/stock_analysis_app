<br>
In finance, return is a profit on an investment. 
It comprises any change in value of the investment, and/or cash flows which the 
investor receives from the investment, such as interest payments or dividends. 
It may be measured either in absolute terms (e.g., dollars) or as a percentage 
of the amount invested. The latter is also called the holding period return.
<br>
A loss instead of a profit is described as a negative return, assuming the 
amount invested is greater than zero.
<br>
The rate of return is a profit on an investment over a period of time, 
expressed as a proportion of the original investment.[2] The time period is 
typically a year, in which case the rate of return is referred to as 
the annual return.
