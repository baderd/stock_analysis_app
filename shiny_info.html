<h3>Rate of return</h3>

<br>
In finance, return is a profit on an investment.
It comprises any change in value of the investment, and/or cash flows which the
investor receives from the investment, such as interest payments or dividends.
It may be measured either in absolute terms (e.g., dollars) or as a percentage
of the amount invested. The latter is also called the holding period return.
<br>
A loss instead of a profit is described as a negative return, assuming the
amount invested is greater than zero.
<br>
The rate of return is a profit on an investment over a period of time,
expressed as a proportion of the original investment.[2] The time period is
typically a year, in which case the rate of return is referred to as
the annual return.
